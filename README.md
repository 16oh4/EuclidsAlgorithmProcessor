# Euclid's Algorithm Processor
This design calculates the greatest common divisor of an integer using Euclid's Algorithm. An ASM-D chart is developed to implement the algorithm at RTL using the Verilog HDL.
The design is simulated for desired operation and implemented in a Nexys-4 DDR board. The integer is input to the FPGA using the switches, and the answer is displayed using the 7-segment displays.
